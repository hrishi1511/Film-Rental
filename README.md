ðŸŽ¬ Unveiling Insights: Navigating Film Rentals with SQL ðŸ“Š

Recently delved into the world of film rentals with a comprehensive SQL project, assisting a friend in making informed business decisions for their DVD rental store. Despite the absence of their tech-savvy helper, I successfully navigated through the database schema, extracting valuable insights to drive profitability and customer satisfaction.

Key Highlights:

Uncovered total revenue generated from rentals, monthly rental trends, and average rental rates for films.
Identified the most popular film categories, longest unrated films, and average rental rates broken down by category.
Analyzed customer spending patterns, total rental costs exceeding $200, and films rented multiple times by customers.
